In this repository, I have shared my learning from Snowflake.

- [Data Sharing](https://github.com/bhargav12341996/snowflake_data_engineering/tree/main/Data%20Sharing): From this module, you can find the code on how to create roles, users and grant them access to different warehouses and datamarts.
