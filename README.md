In this repository, I have shared my learning from Snowflake.

- [Data Sharing](https://github.com/bhargav12341996/snowflake_data_engineering/tree/main/Data%20Sharing): From this module, you can find the code on how to create roles, users and grant them access to different warehouses and datamarts.
- [Data Masking](https://github.com/bhargav12341996/snowflake_data_engineering/tree/main/Dynamic%20Masking): From this module, you can find the code on how to dynamically mask important data like credit card number information, SSN information etc.
- [File Format](https://github.com/bhargav12341996/snowflake_data_engineering/tree/main/File%20formats): From this module, you can find the code on how to automatically create file formats and automatically detect the specific file format from a storage location.
- [Handling Unstructured Date](https://github.com/bhargav12341996/snowflake_data_engineering/tree/main/Handling%20Unstructured%20Data): From this module, you can find the code on how to handle unstructured / document type data files like Json.
- [Materialized Views](https://github.com/bhargav12341996/snowflake_data_engineering/tree/main/Materialized%20Views): In this module, I learned how to create views & materialized views. Difference between them in terms of data storage virtually & physically.
- [Caching & Clustering](https://github.com/bhargav12341996/snowflake_data_engineering/tree/main/Performance%20Optimization_Caching%20%26%20clustering): In this module, I learned how performance techniques like caching and clustering works. Manually clustered data based on few columns and also understood how micro-partitioning of data works.
- [Snowpipe](https://github.com/bhargav12341996/snowflake_data_engineering/tree/main/Snowpipe): In this module, wI learned how to create pipes and how can we automate ETL pipelines using them. I've also connected with AWS based on External ID from pipe arn , created events such that once the data is loaded on specific folders on AWS eventually that data is loaded onto Snowflake tables.

I have also explored about staging, storage integration , time travel, retention period, different types of tables like permanent, temporary and transient. I have also deep dived into the concepts like zero copy clong & undrop (recovering data after dropping them by mistake).
